## 🔀 Branch State

```
Local:
  * main              @ 9ef1db9 "Cursor Improvements" (YOU ARE HERE)
    feature/v2-improvements  @ 9ef1db9 (backup)

Remote:
    origin/main       @ 08cd8f7 "work" (19 commits ahead of your base)
    origin/testing    @ 08cd8f7
```

### **Important:**
- Your local `main` has **1 new commit** (your improvements)
- Remote `origin/main` has **19 commits** you don't have
- Branches have **diverged**

## 🚀 What You Can Do

### **Option 1: Test Locally (Current - SAFE)** ✅
```bash
# You're here now - just test the app
# Changes are saved, nothing pushed
# Safest option for testing
```

### **Option 2: Push to Feature Branch (Recommended)**
```bash
# Push your changes to a feature branch
git push origin feature/v2-improvements

# Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
# This keeps main clean and allows review
```

### **Option 3: Merge Remote First, Then Push**
```bash
# Get the 19 commits from remote
git fetch origin
git pull origin main --rebase

# Test everything works
# Then push
git push origin main
```

### **Option 4: Replace Remote (⚠️ Destructive)**
```bash
# Only if you're SURE you want to overwrite remote
# This discards the 19 commits on origin/main
git push origin main --force

# ⚠️ Use with caution!
```

## 📋 Quick Commands

### View your commit:
```bash
git show HEAD
git log -1 --stat
```

### See what's different from remote:
```bash
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main        # What remote has
git log origin/main..HEAD        # What you have
```

### Create and push feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/v2-improvements
git push origin feature/v2-improvements
```

### If you want to start over:
```bash
# Your work is in feature/v2-improvements backup
git reset --hard origin/main     # Reset to remote
git checkout feature/v2-improvements  # Switch to your work
```

   - Volume controls
   - Navigation buttons
   - Haptic feedback
   - Connection testing
   - Settings validation
3. **Decide on merge strategy**:
   - Do you need the 19 commits from remote?
   - Or are your changes independent?
4. **Push when ready**:
   - Feature branch (safest)
   - Or merge + push to main
